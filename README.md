## 🗓️ Daily Progress  

### 🧠 **Day 1:** Data Loading and Initial Exploration  
- Imported dataset and performed first-level inspection.  
- Checked for missing values and duplicates.  
- Identified key columns and their data types.

### 🧹 **Day 2:** Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
- Cleaned missing values in columns (`country`, `date_added`, `rating`).  
- Converted `date_added` to datetime format.  
- Handled inconsistencies in categorical data.  
- Exported a cleaned version of the dataset.

### 📊 **Day 3:** Exploratory Data Analysis — Overview  
- Analyzed content type distribution (Movies vs TV Shows).  
- Counted movies and shows per release year.  
- Visualized using bar and pie charts.  

### 🎬 **Day 4:** Genre and Duration Insights  
- Explored genres and duration data.  
- Analyzed the most common genres for both Movies and TV Shows.  
- Cleaned and standardized `duration` column.  
- Visualized duration distribution and top genres.  

### 🎥 **Day 5:** Director and Month-wise Insights  
- Analyzed top directors and their genre trends.  
- Created a heatmap showing content additions by month and year.  
- Gained insight into release seasonality and production trends.

### 🌍 **Day 6:** Country-wise and Rating-based Analysis  
- Identified top countries producing Netflix content.  
- Created a world heatmap of content distribution.  
- Explored rating distribution across content types.  
- Found that TV-MA and TV-14 dominate Netflix’s catalog.

### 📆 **Day 7:** Yearly and Monthly Trends Dashboard  
- Extracted and visualized yearly and monthly content additions.  
- Compared growth patterns of Movies vs TV Shows.  
- Built a combined dashboard showing total yearly and monthly trends.

### 🌎 **Day 8:** Region-wise Distribution & Visualization  
- Grouped countries into continents (regions).  
- Analyzed regional content contributions.  
- Compared Movies vs TV Shows percentage per region.  
- Visualized top 5 countries with highest content production.

### 📈 **Day 9:** Growth & Genre Trends Over Time  
- Analyzed yearly growth patterns of Netflix content.
